    "Hauz Khas Village": {
      "vibe": "artsy, bohemian, a bit pricey",
      "universal_tip": "Insider tip: Avoid the main lake-view cafes. Find the small, unnamed tea stall near the entrance. The tea is better and cheaper, and you'll meet actual artists, not just influencers."

    "Chandni Chowk": {
      "vibe": "chaotic, historical, foodie paradise",
      "universal_tip": "Real secret: Go to 'Paranthe Wali Gali' but your main goal is to find 'Kuremal Mohan Lal Kulfi' deep inside the market. It's a life-changing fruit-stuffed kulfi.",
      "warning": "Be careful with your phone and wallet, it gets very crowded."

    "India Gate": {
      "vibe": "patriotic, open-air, popular for picnics",
      "universal_tip": "Instead of just looking at the gate, walk the full length of Kartavya Path towards the Rashtrapati Bhavan as the sun sets. The view is spectacular. Also, grab a chuski (shaved ice) from a nearby vendor."
    },
    "Khan Market": {
      "vibe": "upscale, trendy, lots of cafes and boutiques",
      "universal_tip": "While the main market is great for shopping, the real gems are the small, independent bookstores tucked away in the middle lanes. They have fantastic collections you won't find elsewhere."
